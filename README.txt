Project description:

This website and webapplication consists of simple DOM manipulation for smooth browsing of my website. There is as well a web application that will direct you to the nearest place (usually a liquor store) that sells Soju.

This project was intended to get my foot in the door of coding in JavaScript. I as well used this project as a way to learn how to go through API documentation.
