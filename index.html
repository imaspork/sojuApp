                Hi. This is my revamped website. Rather than have a navigation bar, I'm forcing you to interact with my website to find
                my personal, professional, and hobbies sections. Don't worry, it's not rocket science.

                Here's some random tidbits about myself! I have been gaming for longer than I can remember. I used to play Rainbow Six Siege at a collegiate competitive level, and I had a great time doing so! I have never owned an automatic car, though sometimes I wish I did. I currently reside in Riverside, California, but I am from San Jose, California. Next, I'll tell you a bit about myself at a professional level.

                <h1>Professional</h1>
                I'm currently a student at the University of California Riverside. I'm set to graduate in Fall 2020 with a Film and Media degree. I have prior work experience as a Web Content Specialist at <a style='color:#FEDF00;' href='https:CORSAIR.com' target='_blank'>Corsair</a> as an intern. I as well have experience managing social media for a photography studio. I have aspirations to work as a web developer and I have been driving myself rigorously in that direction. I have taken some computer science courses such as CS010, but I am mostly self taught.

                <h1>Hobbies</h1>
                As mentioned earlier, one of my biggest passions is gaming. I started out playing games on the GameCube at a daycare, which transition to PC games such as MapleStory. Eventually I transitioned over to more multiplayer games and I've been playing a wide variety of games ever since. I as well enjoy photography and videography thouroughly! There will be an imagine slideshow next so you can see some of my favorite photographs :)
